# Zutil

This project is a collection of utility classes and methods that I use in most 
of my projects. Some of the code is incomplete and might never be completed 
(If no one is requesting otherwise :D).

**A word of warning:** This project is mostly used as a sandbox to implement 
APIs and functions I think are interesting. So there are no guaranties that 
classes and methods will stay as they are, I'm often refactoring the code and 
moving things around.

## Documentation
Unfortunately, there is no dedicated documentation available. The only documentation
is the JavaDoc in the source code and the JUnit test cases as usage examples.

## Running the tests

Execute all JUnit test-cases by running: 
```
mvn verify
```
